What worked:
- I thought flex boxes worked really great in this assignment and made it very easy to resize etc.

- JSON worked for populating the answers as well

What didn't work:
- I struggled to figure out how to get the buttons to work in the JSON version
- I wanted to get unchecked boxes to go back to an opacity of 1 when hovered over but could not

Extra credit:
- I did both the styling and JSON options
